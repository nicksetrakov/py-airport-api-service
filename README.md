# Airport-API

The Airport API service, built on Django REST, is specifically crafted to 
monitor flights originating from airports globally. Providing comprehensive 
details on airports, planes, flights, routes, and beyond, this API functions 
as a powerful tool for effectively managing and analyzing data associated 
with air travel.


## Installing using GitHub

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
 - Redis must be already installed for locally run server without Docker
 - Docker must be already installed for run server with docker-compose
 - Python3 must be already installed. 

## Run the project locally without Docker

## Installed

1. Clone the repository:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/nicksetrakov/py-airport-api-service
```
2. Go to the project directory:
```shell
cd py-airport-api-service
```
3. Create a virtual Python engine and activate it:
```shell
python -m venv venv 
source venv/bin/activate(on macOS)
venv\Scripts\activate(on Windows)
```
4. Set the project assignments:
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Configuration Environment Variables:
  - Create a file named .env, using .env.example as an example.
  - Make sure you have replaced all the dummy keys with your actual data.

## Starting the server
1. Create database migrations:
```shell
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

2. Load fake data to db:
```shell
python manage.py generate_fake_data
```

3.  Run redis server 
```bash
sudo service redis-server start
```

4. Start the development server:
```shell
python manage.py runserver
```

The API should now be accessible at http://localhost:8000/

## RUN with Docker

Docker should b—É installed

```shell
docker-compose build
```
```shell
docker-compose up
```
The API should now be accessible at http://localhost:8001/

# Getting access
 - create user api/user/register/
 - get access token api/user/token/

 - To authenticate, include the obtained token in your request headers with the format:
```shell
 - Authorization: Bearer <your-token>
```

## API Documentation

- The API is documented using the OpenAPI standard.
- Access the API documentation by running the server and navigating to http://localhost:8000/api/doc/swagger/
  or http://localhost:8000/api/doc/redoc/.

## Features of the project:

- **Information Restriction**:
Communication between administrators and regular users is limited, ensuring users access only entitled information.

- **Airport Details**:
Retrieve comprehensive data on global airports, including names, airport codes, and proximity to major cities and countries.

- **Route Insights**:
Access details about different routes, encompassing departure and destination airport names along with the distance between them.

- **Airplane Details**:
Retrieve information about airplanes, such as their names, types, passenger row counts, and seat numbers per row.
The system includes a built-in function for downloading and storing airplane images.

- **Flight Overview**:
Obtain detailed flight information, including route specifics, departure and arrival times, aircraft details, and seat availability.
Filter the flight list by departure and arrival dates for added convenience.

- **Order Status**:
Authenticated users can review their order information.

- **Ticket Details**:
Facilitates the addition of flight tickets, allowing users to specify row and seat numbers for the order.

- **Authentication Mechanism**:
Users can create profiles by providing an email address and password.
The API employs JWT (JSON Web Tokens) authentication to safeguard sensitive flight data.

- **Caching with Redis**:
Implement caching for the FlightViewSet to improve performance by storing query results in Redis for 2 hours.

- **Error Logging**:
Critical server errors are logged to a file (logs/errors.log) for easier debugging and maintenance.

- **Database Initialization**:
Automated database initialization scripts to check if the database is empty and populate it with sample data if necessary.

- **Docker Integration**:
Use of Docker and Docker Compose for consistent development and deployment environments. Includes configurations for PostgreSQL and Redis.

- **Data Management Commands**:
Custom Django management commands for tasks like generating fake data and checking database status.

- **API Documentation**:
Extend and enhance API documentation using drf-spectacular, providing clear and interactive API documentation.

- **Advanced Querying**:
Complex querying capabilities with support for filtering, searching, and ordering on various fields related to flights, routes, and airports.

- **Access Control**:
Implement custom permissions to restrict access based on user roles, ensuring sensitive operations are limited to authorized personnel.

- **Automatic Data Annotations**:
Annotate queryset results with calculated fields, such as the number of tickets available for each flight.

- **Media Management**:
Manage and serve media files (e.g., airplane images) efficiently, with support for file storage configurations.

These features collectively enhance the functionality, security, and performance of the airport management system, providing a robust solution for handling complex aviation data and operations.
